        <h2>How to go</h2>
        <img src="way.png">
        <h3>Take a bus from Shin-Fuji Station</h3>
        <p>Every day from July to September; on weekends in May, June, and October, buses depart from Shin-Fuji Station to the fifth station of Fujinomiyaguchi.
        In addition, buses depart from Mishima Station in July and August.
        Mishima Station and Shin-Fuji Station are halfway stations on the JR Tokaido Shinkansen.</p>
        <h3>Take a bus from Mishima Station</h3>
        <p>The bus from Shin-Fuji Station to Fujinomiya Exit 5th Station will stop at Fuji and Fujinomiya Stations.
        A one-way trip from Shin-Fuji Station to the 5th station takes two hours and costs 2,310 yen, and a round-trip ticket is 3,000 yen.
        Note that only the Echo train of the Tokaido Shinkansen will stop at Shin-Fuji Station.</p>
        <h3>Take a taxi or rent a car</h3>
        <p>The toll-free road to the fifth station of Fujinomiyaguchi is very roundabout, 
        and ordinary cars are prohibited during the climbing season, 
        and ordinary cars are also prohibited from entering the winter from late November to late April. If there are a total of four people traveling together, taking a taxi is also quite cost-effective </p>
