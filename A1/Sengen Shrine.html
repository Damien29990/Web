        <p>There are more than one thousand "Fuji Sengen Shrines" in Japan, dedicated to the Shinto god of Mount Fuji-Hoki Hananokai Yahime.
        The Sengen Shrine in Fujiyoshida, formerly known as Kitaguchi Hongu Sengen Shrine, is the main Sengen Shrine on the north side of Mount Fuji.
        The main palace is the "Fujiyama Hongu Sengen Taisha" in Fujinomiya. Fujiyoshida's Sengen Shrine is located in a dense cedar forest.
        The current shrineâ€™s construction dates back to 1615 and is one of the important cultural properties. </p>

        <p>In the past, most pilgrims who went up the mountain from the north would start from this shrine.
        Although the trail to the top of the mountain still starts from next to the main hall, in recent years, most climbers have chosen to take a bus or car to the fifth station, which is halfway up the mountain.
        Nearby, bypass the shrine and start climbing Mount Fuji from there </p>
